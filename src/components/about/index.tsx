    <p>
      I'm a self-taught frontend & backend software developer with a passion for
      bringing ideas to life through code. I enjoy writing clean, well
      architected code and am a big proponent of test driven development. I like
      working on anything from UI/UX prototyping, system design, to creating
      scripts & tools.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work I like to work on full-stack web applications with a
      combination of React and GraphQL on the client-side. Some backend
      frameworks I enjoy working with are Node.js and Express along with
      microservices like Docker and AWS.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ultimately I'm a nerd who loves Vim/Emacs, Linux and OSX. I enjoy
      customizing all parts of the development environment and I'm a believer in

      When I'm not behind my computer you can find me exploring the local food
      scene or enjoying a game night with friends.
