description: This very website you're now watching. I wanted something fast and with good SEO for my portfolio, so a static website generator like Gatsby seemed like the best fit. It reads data from markdown files, so it's super easy for me to keep adding Portfolio items as I keep developing stuff. It also has a cool dark mode switch since I couldn't decide between a dark or light design.
